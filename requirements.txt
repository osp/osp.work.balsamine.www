# Fixes ultra slow generation by using code that is not yet merged into the
# official pelican repository. See

# Add two STATIC_ settings. Fix #1982
# STATIC_CREATE_LINKS = False

# Create links instead of copying files. If the content and output
# directories are on the same device, then create hard links. Falls
# back to symbolic links if the output directory is on a different
# filesystem. If symlinks are created, donâ€™t forget to add the -L or
# --copy-links option to rsync when uploading your site.

# STATIC_CHECK_IF_MODIFIED = False

# If set to True, and STATIC_CREATE_LINKS is False, compare mtimes of
# content and output files, and only copy content files that are newer
# than existing output files.
